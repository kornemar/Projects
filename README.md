# Projects

I have recently completed an intensive Data Analytics program at Turing College, where I've developed key skills in data analysis. 

> Turing College is an online data career school in Europe offering remote, self-paced learning designed to train students to be company-ready. Through real-world projects, peer collaboration, and mentorship from industry experts, I gained practical experience and enhanced my readiness for the professional world.

This repository contains the key projects I completed during my studies, organized by relevance and difficulty in descending order.

Each project covers various techniques in data analytics. The course consisted of four modules with multiple sprints.
