> A funnel primarily represents the progression (linear movement) towards a desired outcome in a specified process. Funnel analysis typically involves examining each step in the customer journey, assessing clickthrough rates and drop-off rates at each stage. When comparing multiple funnels, you may also be interested in the total conversion rate, an overall performance metric that indicates how effectively the funnel converts customers to achieve the specified goal.
