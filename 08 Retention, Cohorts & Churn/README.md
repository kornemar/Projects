> **Cohort analysis** groups users into coherent cohorts, providing more insight than simple overall metrics like Monthly Active Users (MAU) or Daily Active Users (DAU). It lays the foundation for a better understanding of user behavior.
>
> **Churn and retention analyses** are crucial for web, e-commerce, and subscription-based businesses. These analyses, often based on cohort analysis, help determine how long users stay with a product and how much revenue they generate during their lifetime.

## Objectives

- Understand what cohort analysis is and its benefits compared to other conventional methods of understanding customers
- Learn about retention/churn analysis, including different types and when to use each. Gain hands-on experience conducting retention/churn analysis using spreadsheets and SQL
