> Developing soft skills is crucial for data analysts. It’s important not only to present findings clearly but also to communicate in a way that is understood by different audiences. As a data analyst, I may need to present my findings to various stakeholders within a company.

## Objectives
Learn what makes communication effective, who stakeholders are, and how to communicate with them. Understand the different types of communication mediums appropriate for various stakeholders.

## Data Source
- `AdventureWorks`
- CSV files created with SQL queries and connected to the Tableau dashboard as the data source:
    - [AdventureWorks.Customer.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UdqRdisPSoVL-uJYJONJZvQeZfxRbuw3/view?usp=drive_link)

## Task 
As a data analyst at AdventureWorks, I was asked to create one dashboard to be used for two presentations (created using PowerPoint) tailored for the Executive Leadership and Finance departments. The objective was to provide insights and communicate them effectively, considering the specific needs of each audience.
