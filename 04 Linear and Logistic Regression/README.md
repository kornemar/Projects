> A linear regression model is used to forecast trends, such as predicting how much revenue a company will generate or how many items a shop will sell.
> 
> A logistic regression model is used for classification tasks, with the model's estimates representing probabilities in the interval [0,1]. For example, you might use logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of your favorite team winning a match or whether your customers will pay their debts.
