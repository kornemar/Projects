> A **linear regression** model is used to forecast trends, such as predicting how much revenue a company will generate or how many items a store will sell.
> 
> A **logistic regression** model is used for classification tasks, , where the modelâ€™s output represents probabilities between 0 and 1. For example, you might use logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of your favorite team winning a match or whether a customers will repay their debt.

## Objectives
- Learn and practice using linear and logistic regression
- Learn how to interpret model parameters
- Understand goodness-of-fit metrics

## Data Source
The [dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZ88HZd75ONCiWr7plt9QYFmuJmaV15nt5NWRZhpuug/edit?gid=1437577042#gid=1437577042) is from ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides patient information.


## Task
Create a logistic regression model to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients:
- Build a logistic regression model and estimate predictions
- Interpret the model's coefficients and odds ratios
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics

## Result
[Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/kornemar/Projects/blob/main/04%20Linear%20and%20Logistic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression.xlsb) created in Excel using analysis tools such as Data Analysis, XLMiner, and Solver
